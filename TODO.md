# TODO: Integrate Real Price Scraping

1. ✅ Update package.json to add missing dependencies (puppeteer, node-cache, express-rate-limit).
2. ✅ Expand server.js to add scrapers for Flipkart, Reliance Digital, Croma, and Official Store.
3. ✅ Modify index.html to fetch real prices from /api/compare instead of simulateComparison.
4. ✅ Ensure results are sorted by lowest total cost.
5. ✅ Install dependencies with npm install.
6. ✅ Run the server with npm start (listening on 3000).
7. ✅ Test searching "diaper" to verify real prices.
